### About me

I'm a **Ph.D. student** in the [Dept. of Visual Computing and AI at MPI for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/visual-computing-and-artificial-intelligence), advised by [**Prof. Christian Theobalt**](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~theobalt/).  
My research focuses on **generative human model and relighting** and **facial animation and motion synthesis** at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning.

Previously, I completed my **Master's** at [POSTECH Computer Graphics Lab](https://cg.postech.ac.kr) under [**Prof. Seung-Hwan Baek**](https://www.shbaek.com), working on **high-dimensional light properties** ([NeSpoF](https://youngchan-k.github.io/nespof), [spDataset](https://eschoi.com/SPDataset/)) and **light-matter interaction modeling** ([hpBRDF](https://yunseong0518.github.io/projects/hpBRDF/)).  
I received my **B.S.** in Mathematics & Electrical and Electronic Engineering from **Yonsei University**.
